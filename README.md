# Ukrainian Cafe

[View the live project here.]()

The Ukrainian Cafe website is made for a cafe. This website shows today's specials, menu, contact information, and opening hours. Potential customers can register and book a table online using a form on the "Booking" page of the website. 
Users are able to view pages like the home page, menu and the contact page, also to create an account, sign in, make a booking and view bookings, which unregistered users don't have access to. Through the booking and the view booking navbar link users can access their bookings, edit and delete them. Site user administrators have access to all bookings and all create, edit and delete functionalities.

The website is designed to be responsible on a range of devices.
